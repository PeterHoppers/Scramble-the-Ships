  - textToDisplay: We bring some good news, pilot! We have successfully been able
      to isolate the alien virus enough to bring your firing systems back online.
  - textToDisplay: "It\u2019s important to note that spawning a missile does take
      a considerable amount of energy to do. While normally your ship would be equipped
      to constantly blast at the aliens, the lowered max energy of your ship makes
      that more difficult."
  - textToDisplay: "We hope you don\u2019t have to use them too often as you travel
      through this next sector."
