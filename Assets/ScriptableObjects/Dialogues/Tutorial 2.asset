  - textToDisplay: It looks like the alien forces have planted some turrets to deter
      us. Your scouting mission has started to produce some helpful intel.
  - textToDisplay: Your time-modifying grid will capture any foreign objects into
      its time manipulation. This will give you time to plan your route around the
      obstacles, although we understand that process might be trivial for an experienced
      pilot like you.
