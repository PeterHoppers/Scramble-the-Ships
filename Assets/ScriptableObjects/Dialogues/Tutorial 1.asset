    textToDisplay: "Your time-modifying grid movement system activates whenever obstacles
      are detected, pilot. This system pauses time for about a second or until you
      move your joystick in the direction you want to move. After your ship finishes
      moving, it\u2019ll pause time again."

    textToDisplay: "This system also previews where obstacles will be after you move,
      which allows you to react accordingly. If your ship is ever destroyed by them,
      it will rewind time to when you entered the current grid.\r"

    textToDisplay: "While this system is quite helpful, it constantly uses energy.
      If your energy fully depletes, your ship will cease to function and you\u2019ll
      become stranded in space.\r"

    textToDisplay: "To continue to the next grid, move your ship into a white glowing
      square at the top of the grid. This will allow you to transition to the next
      grid safely and recharge some energy.\r"
