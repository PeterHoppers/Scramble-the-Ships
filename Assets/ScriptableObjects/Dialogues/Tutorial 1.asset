    textToDisplay: As you enter alien territory, pilot, your ship will activate its
      time-modifying grid movement system whenever it detects obstacles. This system
      pauses time for roughly a second and previews where objects are going until
      you choose an action to perform.

    textToDisplay: "However, this system constantly uses your ship\u2019s energy.
      If your energy fully depletes, you will be stranded in space and suffer the
      consequences, as you well know."

    textToDisplay: "The glowing squares at the top of the grid have been calculated
      as safe transition zones. When you interact with one, you\u2019ll move onto
      the next collection of obstacles and recharge some of your energy."
