  - textToDisplay: "You\u2019ve entered alien territory, pilot. Now, your ship will
      activate its cutting-edge time-modifying grid movement system whenever it detects
      obstacles.\r\r"
  - textToDisplay: "If your ship is ever destroyed by said obstacles, it will rewind
      time back to when it first activated this system. The ship only has the ability
      to do this a certain number of times.\r"
  - textToDisplay: Some squares in the grid have been calculated as safe transition
      zones. They should be the glowing ones at the top of the grid. Navigate through
      the grid to them to move onto the next screen.
