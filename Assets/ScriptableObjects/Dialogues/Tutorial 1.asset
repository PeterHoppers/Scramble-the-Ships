  - textToDisplay: "You\u2019ve entered alien territory, pilot. Now, your ship will
      activate its cutting-edge time-modifying grid movement system whenever it detects
      obstacles. While this uses energy, your ship has been equipped with plenty."
  - textToDisplay: "If your ship is ever destroyed, it will rewind time back to when
      you discovered the obstacles at the cost of some energy. We don\u2019t need
      to mention what will happen if your energy reaches zero.\r"
  - textToDisplay: Some squares in the grid have been calculated as safe transition
      zones. They should be the glowing ones at the top of the grid. Navigating through
      the grid to them will recharge some of your energy and move you to the next
      screen.
