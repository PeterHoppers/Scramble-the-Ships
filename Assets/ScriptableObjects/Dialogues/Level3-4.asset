  - textToDisplay: As these sectors increase in length and complexity, the limited
      energy amount that your ship can carry could start to impact your ability to
      successfully navigate through it all.
  - textToDisplay: "And so, we\u2019ve sent a couple of energy packs to arrive in
      your sector. One should be on the screen you are on now. Simply fly your ship
      into it and it will absorb its contents."
